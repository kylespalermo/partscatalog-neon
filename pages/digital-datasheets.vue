      Digitizing your product data takes discovery to a higher level than data
      locked in a PDF.

        For a web crawler to discover contents in PDF, there are several rules
        and tags you need to embed in the PDF for Search Engine Optimization and
        other conventional search means on the worldwide web. And those stunning
        images you use to convey a key message and grab and Engineers attention,
        well those images are invisible to web crawlers except for any metadata
        that is included in the image data.

        A benefit of digitizing your product data and service parameters is that
        a digital datasheet is more flexible than a PDF. Another benefit is
        potential customers don’t need to have “PDF Scraper” software to extract
        text, numbers, and symbols from your datasheets.

        Digital datasheets can also aid your Engineering team to more quickly
        and easily download key parametric data and run a compare see how your
        products compare to your competitors
