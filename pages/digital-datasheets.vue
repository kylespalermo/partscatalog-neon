      Digitizing your product data takes discovery to a higher level than data

        For web crawlers to reliably index the contents of a PDF, the file must
        include a proper text layer, structural tags, and embedded metadata.
        PDFs that consist mainly of images or lack semantic tagging provide
        little usable information to search engines. Likewise, product images or
        diagrams included within a PDF are generally non-indexable unless
        descriptive metadata is explicitly embedded in the image object.

        Digitizing product data and service parameters provides greater
        flexibility than distributing static PDFs. Digital datasheets expose
        structured data directly, eliminating the need for third-party PDF
        extraction tools to parse text, tables, or symbols.

        In addition, digital datasheets allow engineering teams to access and
        download standardized parametric data more efficiently. This enables
        faster comparisons across product lines and more consistent benchmarking
        against competitive components.
