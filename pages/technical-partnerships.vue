        One of the services we feel strongly about is forming technical
        partnerships. Being a technical search engine, we’re in a unique
        position to connect the dots between companies that don’t know the other
        exists.

        Prior to founding of Exosearch, our Founders successfully decoded, and
        mapped out, rocky, often zigzag paths, to make unlikely partnerships a
        reality.

        We have met strong leaders in great companies that were so frustrated by
        blocking efforts to build something greater. they simply left the
        employer.

        The reality is Partnering negotiations are not a sure thing, but in
        approximately three in five partnerships we suggested, initiated, and
        negotiated, we helped enabled a long term partnerships with two parties,
        sometimes three, to design and manufacture something that neither could
        have done without the others technology, skill, and market position.

        Two of our more successful partnerships with small companies, resulted
        in acquisitions by the larger technology partner that reached $90M
